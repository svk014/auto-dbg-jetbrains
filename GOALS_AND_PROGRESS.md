# Auto-DBG JetBrains Plugin - Goals and Progress

## Phase 1: Core Debugging Integration âœ…
- [x] Set up IntelliJ plugin template and basic project structure.
- [x] Create a tool window with a log panel to display debug information.
- [x] Implement `DebuggerIntegrationService` to listen for debugger events.
- [x] Add dropdown to select active debug sessions and connect button.
- [x] Implement pause functionality for debug sessions.
- [x] **MAJOR**: Transform architecture from hardcoded methods to composition pattern.
- [x] **MAJOR**: Implement language-specific debugger components with Java implementation.
- [x] **MAJOR**: Create HTTP REST API server with automatic endpoint discovery.

## Phase 2: Advanced Debugging Features ðŸ”„
- [ ] Implement variable modification capabilities (`setVariable`).
- [ ] Add breakpoint management (set, remove, conditional breakpoints).
- [ ] Create step-through debugging controls (step over, step into, step out).
- [ ] Implement call stack navigation and inspection.
- [ ] Add support for JavaScript/Node.js debugging.
- [ ] Add support for Python debugging.

## Phase 3: AI Integration and Automation ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Integrate with AI/LLM services for automated debugging suggestions.
- [ ] Implement context-aware code analysis during debugging.
- [ ] Add automated bug detection and fix suggestions.
- [ ] Create debugging workflow automation features.

## Phase 4: Polish and Release ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Polish UI/UX and error handling.
- [ ] Prepare for publishing to JetBrains Marketplace.

## Summary

**Auto-DBG** is an IntelliJ plugin that exposes debugging capabilities through a REST API, enabling AI agents and external tools to programmatically interact with active debug sessions. The plugin uses a composition-based architecture that supports multiple programming languages through pluggable implementations.

### Key Features Completed:
- **Multi-language Debugging Support**: Pluggable architecture with full Java implementation
- **REST API Server**: HTTP server with automatic endpoint discovery and JSON responses  
- **Real-time Debug Integration**: Automatic detection and connection to active debug sessions
- **Comprehensive Data Access**: Stack frames, call stacks, and variable inspection with nested object support

### Current API Capabilities:
- `GET /tools` - Discover all available API endpoints
- `GET /api/debugger/frame/{depth}` - Retrieve stack frame at specific depth
- `GET /api/debugger/callstack` - Get complete call stack with configurable depth
- `GET /api/debugger/variables` - Extract variables with nested object inspection
- `POST /api/debugger/variable/set` - Set variable values (placeholder - Phase 2)
- `POST /api/debugger/breakpoint` - Set breakpoints (placeholder - Phase 2)

## Progress Log

### 2025-08-01
- **Architectural Transformation Complete**: Successfully refactored from hardcoded debugging methods to composition pattern using language-specific implementations
- **Java Implementation Suite**: Built complete Java debugging support with `JavaFrameRetriever`, `JavaCallStackRetriever`, and `JavaVariableRetriever` using IntelliJ XDebugger APIs
- **Factory Pattern Integration**: Implemented `DebuggerComponentFactory` with automatic language detection and component creation
- **HTTP API Server**: Created fully functional REST API server with:
  - Random port assignment to avoid conflicts
  - Automatic route registration and JSON serialization
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Annotation-Based Documentation**: Established `@ApiEndpoint` and `@ApiParam` as single source of truth for API documentation, eliminating duplicate KDoc maintenance
- **API Discovery Service**: Built automatic endpoint discovery system that generates OpenAPI-compatible documentation from annotations
- **Code Quality Improvements**: Removed all KDoc duplication, resolved compilation errors, and established consistent documentation patterns

### 2025-07-31
- **Architecture Refactoring**: Started restructuring the codebase to use composition pattern and separate language-specific implementations.
- **Java Implementation Structure**: Planning to move methods to separate Java-specific classes that can be extended/replaced for other language implementations.
- **IntelliJ Platform Issue**: Encountered dependency resolution error with `product-info.json` in IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2.5 on macOS ARM64. Error suggests issue with IntelliJ Platform Gradle plugin resolving product information files.
- **Resolution**: Fixed IntelliJ platform dependency issues by using standard XDebugger APIs instead of internal JDI classes.

### 2025-07-25
- Initial plugin template set up and verified in WebStorm.
- Tool window with log panel created.
- DebuggerIntegrationService implemented to listen for debug events.
- Log panel now displays debugger events and tool window messages.
- Added dropdown and connect button to interact with active debug sessions.
- Pause functionality for debug sessions implemented and tested.
